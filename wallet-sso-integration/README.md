 To ensure smooth onboaring of this, please take note of the following keypoints.

## Important Limitations

- Please use `zbyte-wallet-ui-sdk` compatible React version (17.0.2) for your project.
- Use all other libraries compactible with adjusted react version (e.g. react-dom, etc)
- Use the following command to install the correct version of React:

  ```bash
  npm install react@17.0.2 react-dom@17.0.2
  ```

- Refer to the provided example's `package.json` for guidance on setting up your project.

## Example Usage

To understand the implementation details and configurations, explore the src provided in the `src` directory. This example has 2 parts,

- First is the authentication with zbyte-sso (based on keycloak), find its minified library in `src/keycloak` and initialization at `src/context/keycloak.tsx`.
- Second is the wallet initialization in `src/wallet` which further uses `@zbyteio/zbyte-wallet-ui-sdk` library.

The project serves as a practical reference to guide you through the setup and the process of how wallet is authorized and initialized.
